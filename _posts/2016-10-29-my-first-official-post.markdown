Hello and welcome to my website! 

If you somehow stumbled upon this page, then you will know that this is currently a work in progress.
What am I planning to use this website for? Mostly to continue sharpening my programming skills and also to include posts around the IT world in general, my life experiences and the odd funny post. As a first official post, I will talk about how I generated this website and why I chose to use the technologies to build it. 

Until then, enjoy what I currently have!
